This repository demonstrates a common Java error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds.  The `BugSolution.java` file shows how to fix this by implementing bounds checking before accessing array elements. This is crucial for robust and error-free Java programs.
